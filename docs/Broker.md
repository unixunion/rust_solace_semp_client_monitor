## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**auth_client_cert_revocation_check_mode** | **String** | The client certificate revocation checking mode used when a client authenticates with a client certificate. The allowed values and their meaning are:  &lt;pre&gt; \&quot;none\&quot; - Do not perform any certificate revocation checking. \&quot;ocsp\&quot; - Use the Open Certificate Status Protcol (OCSP) for certificate revocation checking. \&quot;crl\&quot; - Use Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) for certificate revocation checking. \&quot;ocsp-crl\&quot; - Use OCSP first, but if OCSP fails to return an unambiguous result, then check via CRL. &lt;/pre&gt;  | [optional] [default to null]
